Quills is an Enterprise Weblog System for the Plone content management system.
It is designed from the ground up to work well and provide specialized features
for a multi-blog, multi-user environment.

Requires Plone 3.1 or later.


Getting started
---------------

QuillsEnabled allows you to use Plone Folders, Documents and News Items for
blogging. To create a blog, simply add a new Folder and select
"Activate Blog" from the "Actions" menu, then add Pages/New Items for each
new post. Existing folders can be turned into a blog the same way. To change
a Blog back into a plain and boring folder, select "Deactive blog"
from the Actions menu.


Extensions

There are a few packages that add extra functionality to your Blog.

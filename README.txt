======================

Quills is an Enterprise Weblog System for the Plone content management system.
It is designed from the ground up to work well and provide specialized features
for a multi-blog, multi-user environment.

Requires Plone 3.1 or later.


Getting started
===============

QuillsEnabled allows you to use Plone Folders, Documents and News Items for
blogging. To create a blog, simply add a new Folder and select
"Activate Blog" from the "Actions" menu, then add Pages/New Items for each
new post. Existing folders can be turned into a blog the same way. To change
a Blog back into a plain and boring folder, select "Deactive blog"
from the Actions menu.


Extensions
==========

There are a few packages that add extra functionality to your Blog.

quills.remoteblogging
    Use your Blog with any Weblog Editor that supports the `MetaWeblog API`_.
    This feature requires the ``Products.MetaWeblogPASPlugin`` product to
    be installed into your Plone site.

    .. _MetaWeblog API: http://www.metaweblogapi.com/


Pitfalls
========

There is a `slight incompatibility`_ with `Quintagroup's Plone
Comments`_ product. To fix it, open the ZMI of your Plone site and go
to the “portal_form_controler”. There select the tab “Actions” and
delete the overide “discussion_reply_form”.
